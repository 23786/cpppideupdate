<p>LATESTVERSIONBEGIN<br>2.1.0<br>-Adapt macOS 11.0 Big Sur-SNew User Interface-More Stable-Add code completion and realtime diagnostic-Bug Fixes and Improvements-More functions (Search code snippets, Right-click menu, etc.)-For users using macOS 11.0 Big Sur Beta, we strongly suggest you update to this version. For macOS 10.15.* Catalina, you should also update to this version. For macOS 10.14.6 and newer, you can choose to update it. For Macs under macOS 10.14.6, especially macOS 10.13.* High Sierra and macOS 10.12.* Sierra, this update is optional, because we haven't tested them on these old operating systems and the system API may have changed a lot between macOS v10.12.* and v11.*, which may make the application look strange. By the way, there is a new dynamic link library in this version (libclang.dylib, used for code completion and realtime diagnostic, about 200 MB), which is built for macOS 10.14.6, but we aren't sure if it can work on operating systems before macOS 10.14.6.<br>https://github.com/23786/Cppp-IDE/releases/download/v2.1.0/C+++_2_1_0.dmg.zip<br>LATESTVERSIONEND</p>
